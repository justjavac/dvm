NOTE:
  To remove, delete, or uninstall dvm - just remove the `$DVM_DIR` folder (usually `~/.dvm`)
```

### Verify installation

To verify that dvm has been installed, do:

```bash
dvm -V
```

which should output dvm's version if the installation was successful.

### Initialisation

Calling `dvm` will creates an `~/.dvm/` directory if it doesn't exist, and all
installed versions of deno will put into `~/.dvm`.

```
➜  ~  dvm
Creating /Users/justjavac/.dvm
```

### .dvmrc

You can let dvm to writing config to current directery by add the `--local` flag
to `dvm use`. Afterwards, `dvm use`, `dvm install` will use the version
specified in the `.dvmrc` file if no version is supplied on the command line.

For example, to make dvm default to the `1.17.0` release for the current
directory:

```bash
dvm use --local 1.17.0
```

Then when someone else with a copy of your project and run dvm:

```plain
$ dvm use
No version input detect, try to use version in .dvmrc file
Using semver range: 1.17.0
Writing to home folder config
Now using deno 1.17.0
```

## Example

### Listing versions

List all installed versions:

```
➜  ~  dvm list
 * 0.1.0
   0.1.1
   0.1.2
```

The version with a asterisk(`*`) means that this version is the version
currently in use.

### Switching version

```
➜  ~  dvm use 1.1.0
now use deno 1.1.0
➜  ~  dvm use 1.2.0
deno v1.2.0 is not installed. Use `dvm install 1.2.0` to install it first.
```

## Compatibility

- The Shell installer can be used on Windows with
  [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about),
  [MSYS](https://www.msys2.org) or equivalent set of tools.

## Caveats

### unzip is **required**

The program [`unzip`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) is a requirement for
the Shell installer.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/dvm/install.sh | sh
Error: unzip is required to install dvm (see: https://github.com/justjavac/dvm#unzip-is-required).
```

**When does this issue occur?**

During the `install.sh` process, `unzip` is used to extract the zip archive.

**How can this issue be fixed?**

You can install unzip via `brew install unzip` on MacOS or
`apt-get install unzip -y` on Linux(Ubuntu,Debian,Deepin).

### Powershell on Windows is **required**

Currently, we use PowerShell profile to set environment variables due to various
reasons, so it's required.
